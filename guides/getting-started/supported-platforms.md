# Supported platforms

__YAWP!__ supports two platforms as persistence layers: [Google Appengine Datatore](https://cloud.google.com) and [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org).


<div class="platforms">

    <img src="/assets/img/platforms/postgres.png" />
</div>

The main idea is that you can bootstrap your application really fast using the Appengine auto-scaling PaaS
(free to start) and later, if you need, be free move to a IaaS (i.e Amazon AWS) where you can have more control
of the environment.
