# Supported platforms

__YAWP!__ supports two platforms as persistence layers: Google Appengine Datatore and PostgreSQL with JSONB.

_TODO: links and images of platforms_

<!--![An image; this is the alt text](/assets/img/platforms/appengine.png)-->

The objective is to increase this list in the future, but we think that this is really a good base to start with.
The idea is that you can bootstrap your application really fast using the Appengine auto-scaling PaS 
(free to start) and later, if you need, move to a PaS, lets say Amazon AWS, where you have more control of the environment.
