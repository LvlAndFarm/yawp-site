# Supported platforms

__YAWP!__ supports two platforms as persistence layers: [Google Appengine Datatore](https://cloud.google.com) and [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org).


<div class="platforms">
    <img src="/assets/img/platforms/appengine.png" />
    <img src="/assets/img/platforms/postgres.png" />
</div>

The objective is to increase this list in the future, but we think that this is really a good base to start with.
The idea is that you can bootstrap your application really fast using the Appengine auto-scaling PaS 
(free to start) and later, if you need, move to a PaS, lets say Amazon AWS, where you have more control of the environment.
