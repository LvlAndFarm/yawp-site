title: Semantic Versioning
---

Starting with version **1.4.0**, to be released in a few days, YAWP! will adopt the 
[semantic versioning](http://semver.org) scheme to indicate how changes affects its API.

This way, developers can decide better when or not to upgrade to new versions of the 
framework without causing problems to existing apps.

If you are not familiar with the model, it is really simple, here comes the introduction
extracted from the website above.

Given a version number __MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH__, increment the:

* __MAJOR__ version when you make incompatible API changes,
* __MINOR__ version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
* __PATCH__ version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
