This is the very first post on this blog!

From now on, this is where we will announce information about all the 
relevant  releases of the framework, including new features, bugfix, tips, 
usage examples and more.

As you can see, each blog post contains a topic for open discussion. Feel
free to ask questions, give feedbacks or whatever comes to mind. The only rule 
is to be respectful ;)

Thanks for all **YAWP!'s contributors** and **Marry Xmas!**
